# Among-Us-Guide
This is the FREE, open source, and unofficial Among Us guide that has tips and tricks for any situation and any role. I have licensed this under the CC0 1.0 Universal. Also, there will be different versions of the guide, which are legacy versions; they are the previous versions of the guide, and are not the updated versions. These will be under a different branch named "Previous Versions". If anyone wants to contact me to suggest tips and tricks, please put it in the "issues" tab. Note that this is a simple project, and we do not plan on making this look fancy.
