# Among-Us-Guide
This is the FREE, open source, and unofficial Among Us guide that has tips and tricks for any situation and any role. I have licensed this under the CC0 1.0 Universal, which allows the reproduction and editing of different branches, but does not allow copyrighting or sublicensing any versions of this guide. Also, there will be different versions of the guide, which are legacy versions; they are the previous versions of the guide, and are not the updated versions. These will be under a different branch named "Previous Versions". If anyone wants to contact me to suggest tips and tricks, please join https://discord.gg/w4Hqrfc. Note that this is a simple project, and we do not plan on making this look fancy.
