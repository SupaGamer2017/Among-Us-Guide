# Among-Us-Guide
This is the FREE, open source, and unofficial Among Us guide that has tips and tricks for any situation and any role. In order to see them and download them, head over to https://https://github.com/SupaGamer2017/Among-Us-Guide/releases/. I have licensed this under the CC0 1.0 Universal. If anyone wants to contact me to suggest tips and tricks, please put it in the "issues" tab. Note that this is a simple project, and I do not plan on making this look fancy.
